Library for simplifying access to IndexedDB.

IndexedDB is a power data store that runs within the context of the browser. Many browsers support it: Chrome, FireFox, and IE 10 with hopes that Safari will support it soon. 

IndexedDB allows for a richer applications on the client by enabling the data to be stored on the client. Moving data to the client has 3 benefits.
1. Better performance than server side calls.
2. Off-load work from the server to the client.
3. With offline caching (HTML5 feature) you can have a fully disconnected application.
